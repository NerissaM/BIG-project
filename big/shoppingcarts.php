<h1>Online Shopping Carts in Web Development</h1>
<p>Successful web pages are often generating income of some sort for the owner of that website. This is a vital component to people who are vested in the success of a business doing ongoing business with Web Developers. Familiarity with monetizing web pages and how to integrate a shopping cart system into a web page is an important skill for a web developer.  The common form of “shopping cart” describes a sort of specialized content management system that (1) stores product data; (2) provides an administration portal for catalog, order, and customer management; (3) renders product data, product categories, and website information for display to site visitors; (4) serves as the hub for on-site merchandising and cross selling, and (5) passes transactional data to a payment gateway or begins order processing itself (Roggio, 2010).</p>

<p>As shopping carts have become more and more vital to successful business the market has been flooded with different shopping cart options. Its important for a Web Developers to be familiar with the products enough to help clients make a choice that best supports their business. Such as considering the nature of your store, who your target audience is, and where and how you want to sell your goods or services (Juan, 2019) as well as if content you're currently using is supported such as a blog or newsletter service.</p> 

<p>Online shopping unfortunately creates opportunities for theft. Security should be a constant consideration for a Web Developer leading a client through adding Ecommerce. Developers should make sure the online store and its underlying web hosting provider offer a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate or can accommodate a third-party certificate you purchase from someone else. Then make sure to invest in a solid website monitoring tool to make sure you stay on top of any performance or potential security problem with your webstore in real time (Juan, 2019). Having these considerations in mind will help a Web Developer to be more successful in both keeping and protecting their clients as they navigate monetizing their website.
