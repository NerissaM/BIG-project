<h1>Considerations on Developing a Website or Application</h1>

<p>When we are discussing the merits of a responsive website compared to a mobile application we need to start with some definitions. A responsive website is the standard for current website development. It is a web page that scales and behaves in such a way that end user experience is optimized for the type of screen the webpage is being viewed on. A mobile application is not necessarily connected to the internet at all it is engaged with separately from web browsers, of particular note is that after the end user downloads the application it never connect to the internet again. A mobile application is intended for tablet and phone usage where applications make up a significant portion of the way that the end user engages with the device.</p> 

<p>Developing a mobile application is a more significant investment of resources however mobile applications allow users to consume their content quickly offering seamless experience via storing vital data that can be accessed offline … loading a news item or a game that can be read or played without internet connection (Knowarth Technologies,  2017). Additionally a mobile application while not inherently more secure does offer readily integrated security options is an important consideration. With an app, you can use two factor authentication more easily. Using the phone as a way to require something the user knows (their password) AND something they have increases the willingness of the end user to do the extra steps to protect their identity (Bressler, 2016).</p>

<p>In my research both responsive websites and mobile applications are both needed with such frequency that the debate isn't, which is better but when should one use which. A website is a prerequisite of any business that wants to be successful. At the time of this writing a responsive website is what businesses should have built for them as a starting point. Responsive web design is comparatively cheap when measured against the costs of designing a native mobile app from the ground up (Think Mobiles, 2017), which makes it a prudent starting place for a lot of businesses. However as businesses are wanting to scale up, increase their reach, and end user engagement a mobile app can be a excellent investment. Using the two in tandem is often the correct choice for many businesses.
