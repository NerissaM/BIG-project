<h1>Galleries and Their Use in Web Development</h1>

<p>Galleries are a unique topic of consideration for how to be most effective in how we present information in Web Development. Photos can be visually engaging and can keep a user on a website longer however they offer little to visually impaired end users and can actually clutter or be hidden from a page depending on what type of device the end user is engaging a site on and how the site was designed. A gallery of images can be designed to behave responsively, which is a valuable skill for a web developer to have as most websites being designed today are being done with responsivity in mind.</p>

<p>In general developers should be creating galleries with responsivity in mind. To take things a step further there are a number of galleries that are designed to operate like a slider. Sliders—also known as "carousels" or "image sliders"—are interactive elements for showing images or other media in a web page (Dye, 2018). A slider is when a timer is set and the image slides the screen when the timer goes off, changing out the image for the end user with the goal of keeping them engaged on that particular webpage. A jquery slider is designed to work with a touchscreen enabling the end user to create a more custom experience by deciding when they will change out their image or to stay with a particular image.</p>
	
<p>While a developer can write the code to create a slider from scratch using W3 or other quality online tutorials there are limitless options when it comes to choosing a slider that is already coded and just needs the clients unique photos attached. Using a bundle of someone else's code enables to developer to be more consistent, effective with their time, and billing to the client. While there are many free options available online which may be of interest to developers I personally like Slider Revolution as it allows the developer to insert video, gifs, and images into a slider.
